    <h1>Dracula 3D Model</h1>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px;">I have chosen to make a 3D model of the scene when Dracula arrives at Whitby by boat during a terrible storm. The boat, the Demeter, is deserted - except for the dead captain, who has lashed himself to the wheel. Dracula, in the form of an immense dog, leaps off the boat and runs up the 199 steps to Whitby Abbey. This is not only a very important scene in terms of plot (Dracula's arrival in Britain), but it is also one of the most memorable and dramatic scenes in the play.
<br>
<br>
To create my scene, I decided to use Minecraft, because it is good for creating effective dioramas. I used maps and photographs of Whitby to create the harbour accurately, and also looked at the scene in the original book by Bram Stoker for extra details about the setting. Next, I added sound effects to replicate the forboding and menacing atmosphere of the scene. Finally, I filmed the scene manually to create a fluid motion path using the Cinematic Replay camera.</p>
